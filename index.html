      <h3 id="headline">Here's a brief history of Sudan:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>14th and 15th centuries</strong> - Between the 14th
          and 15th centuries, most of Sudan was settled by Arab nomads
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
          <strong> 16th to 19th</strong> - From the 16thâ€“19th
          centuries, central and eastern Sudan were dominated by the
          Funj sultanate, while Darfur ruled the west and the
          Ottomans the north.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
          <strong>19th</strong> - From the 19th century, the entirety
          of Sudan was conquered by Egypt under the Muhammad Ali
          dynasty. It was under Egyptian rule that Sudan acquired
          its modern borders, and began the process of political,
          agricultural, and economic development.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
          <strong>1881</strong> - In 1881, nationalist sentiment in
          Egypt led to the Orabi Revolt, "weakening" the power of the
          Egyptian monarchy, and eventually leading to the occupation
          of Egypt by the United Kingdom. At the same time, religious-
          nationalist fervour in Sudan erupted in the Mahdist Revolt
          led by the self-proclaimed Mahdi Muhammad Ahmad, resulting
          in the establishment of the rebel Caliphate of Omdurman. The
          Mahdist forces were eventually defeated by a joint Egyptian-
          British military force, restoring the authority of the
          Egyptian monarch. However, Egyptian sovereignty in Sudan
          would henceforth be somewhat nominal, as the true power in
          both Egypt and Sudan was now the United Kingdom.
        </li>
        <br>

        <li>
          <strong>1899</strong> - In 1899, under British pressure,
          Egypt agreed to share sovereignty over Sudan with the United
          Kingdom as a condominium. In effect, Sudan was governed as a
          British possession.[15] The 20th century saw the growth of
          both Egyptian and Sudanese nationalism focusing on ending
          the United Kingdom's occupation.
